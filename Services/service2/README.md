A basic project explaining the use of intent service. 
The IntentService class in Android is a subclass of Service that provides a simplified way to handle asynchronous tasks in the background. It allows you to offload time-consuming operations from the main thread, such as network requests or database operations, without blocking the user interface.

IntentService manages the worker thread and message queue for you, so you don't have to handle thread management manually. You can send requests to the service by creating Intents and calling `startService()` with the intent as a parameter. The service processes each request in a sequential manner, one at a time, and automatically stops itself when there are no more pending requests.

It also provides default implementation for handling intents, including the creation of a worker thread, processing each intent in `onHandleIntent()`, and stopping the service when all requests are completed. Additionally, it handles service lifecycle events and automatic termination when idle.

Overall, IntentService simplifies the development of background tasks by encapsulating the complexity of threading and message handling, making it easier to perform background operations in an Android application.
